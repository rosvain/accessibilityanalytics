        <h1>A History of Sea Power: Naval Beginnings</h1>
        <h2 class="header">Naval history is more than a sequence of battles. It's the story of the sea.</h2>

      <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-letter">C</span>ivilization and sea power arose from the temperate Mediterranean, and the progress of archeological research has shown that civilizations and empires had been reared in the Mediterranean on sea power long before the dawn of history.</p>
      <p>We know, for instance, that an Egyptian king some 2000 years before Christ possessed a fleet of 400 fighting ships. But it appears now that long before this time the island of Crete was a <a>great naval and commercial power</a>. Indeed, the Cretans may have taught the Egyptians something of the art of building sea-going ships for trade and war.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“Neither deals unfairly with the other; the Carthaginians never touch the gold till it comes up to the estimated value of their goods, nor do the natives carry off the goods till the gold has been taken away.” — <a>Herodotus</a><sup>2</sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Early in Egyptian history the distinction was made between the "round" ships of commerce and the "long" ships of war. <a>The round ship</a>, as the name suggests, was built for cargo capacity rather than for speed. It depended on sail, with the oars as auxiliaries. was designed for speed, depending on oars and using sail only as auxiliary.</p>
      <p>And while the round ship was of deep draft and rode to anchor, the shallow flat-bottomed long ships were drawn up on shore. The Phœnicians took the Egyptian and Cretan models and engineered significant improvements.</p>

      <p><strong>They lowered the bows of the fighting ships</strong>, added a beak near the water's edge, and strung the shields of the fighting men along the bulwarks to protect the rowers. To increase the driving force and the speed, they added a second and then a third bank of oars, thus producing the "bireme" and the "trireme."<sup>3</sup> These were the types they handed down to the Greeks, and in fact there was little advance made beyond the Phœnician war galley during all the subsequent centuries of the Age of the Oar.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>About the beginning of the seventh century before Christ, the Phœnicians had reached the summit of their power on the seas. Their extraordinary wealth tempted the king of Assyria, in 725 B.C., to cross the mountain barrier with a great army.</p>
      <p>He had no difficulty in overrunning the country, but the inhabitants fled to their colonies. The great city of Tyre, being on an island, defied the invader, and finally the Assyrian king gave up and withdrew to his own country.</p>
      <h2>The Sea Power of Rome: The Punic Wars</h2>
      <p>It was inevitable that as Rome expanded, her interests should collide with those of Carthage. The two powers had rival interests in Sicily, and the clash of these brought on the war in the year 264 B.C. There followed a mortal struggle between Rome and Carthage that extended through three distinct wars and a period of aver a hundred years.</p>
      <p>When the two nations faced each other in arms, Carthage had the advantage of prestige and the greatest navy in the world. Her weaknesses lay in: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the strife of political factions; and</li>
        <li>the mercenary character of her forces, so characterized because:<ul class="level2"><li>Carthaginians considered it beneath their dignity to be a private;</li><li>the rank and file, therefore, were hired or pressed into service from the subject provinces; and so</li><li>troops would do well so long as campaigns promised plunder, but would become disaffected if things went wrong.</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Romans, on the other hand, had only a small navy and no naval experience; their strength lay in their legionaries.</p>
      <h3>The First Three Years</h3>
      <p>For the first three years Carthaginians raided the coasts of Sicily and Italy with impunity. Finally, Rome created a fleet. First contact wasn't encouraging. The new fleet — constructed in two months — consisted of 100 quinqueremes and 30 triremes. Seventeen of these were blockaded in the harbor of Messina by twenty Carthaginian ships, and the Roman commander was obliged to surrender after his crews had landed and escaped.</p>
      <p>The next encounter was a different story. The Romans, realizing their ignorance of naval tactics and their superiority in land fighting, determined to make the next naval battle as nearly as possible like an engagement of infantry. Accordingly the ships were fitted with boarding gangways with a huge hooked spike at the end, like the beak of a crow, which gave them their name, "corvi" or "crows."<sup>4</sup></p>

      <ol class="footnote-list">
        <li>It is interesting to note that the earliest empires, <a href="javascript:void(0)">Assyria and Egypt</a>, were not naval powers, because they arose in rich river valleys abundantly capable of sustaining their inhabitants. They did not need to command the sea.</li>
        <li>History, translated by Geo. Rawlinson, vol. III, p. 144.</li>
        <li>A bireme is an ancient oared galley warship with two decks of oars and manned by 120 rowers. A trieme has three decks manned by approximately 170 rowers. Contrary to popular perception, rowers were not 'galley slaves' but rather free men.</li>

          <p class="comment">This is such a great series. So interesting and easily digestible. I've been using it with my class of 10th graders as we cover ancient history. It's been really illuminating for them to see how advanced these civilizations were politically, mathematically and scientifically.</p>

          <p class="comment">You've skipped over some pretty major periods of naval history dude–like 250 years of history! What about Athens? The Persian War? The Peloponnesian War?</p>
